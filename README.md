# Yeah, Welcome To My Complication Script!
Let Me Say Something

# Introduction
Here, I'll introduce myself:
My name is Arvie
I live in Indonesia
I'm 12 years old! (2025)

# Question
üó£Ô∏è: Why can you write scripts?
Me: Because I asked ChatGPT or Claude for help to solve my script problems. I just gave the two AI commands, and boom, my script was created (not entirely AI-made scripts).

üó£Ô∏è: Why are you interested in scripting?
Me: Because I saw people who were already good at scripting, and they said, "This coding skill is very useful for the future," so I became interested.

üó£Ô∏è: Why did you choose the Roblox Lua script?
Me: Maybe it's easy to make? Because the script doesn't require much code, it's easy to use, like JavaScript, CSS, Python, HTML, and others.

# Back To Topic
Here's the script I made!

-- Natural Disaster --
-- Pull A Friend! --
-- TP/Tween GUI --
-- Current Position Player --

That's it for now. Other scripts are coming!

# Goodbye!
